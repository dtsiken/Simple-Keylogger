A Simple Keylogger Witten in Python saves a Text File with Current Day and Date and also has a Day, Date, Time, and Year for every Keystroke that wrote nice and readable. to make it simple the text file created is same as path of this script at the time you run it and you can modify the code to change the path of the output file 

First we need to install in the terminal type pip install pynput.

This is the rewrite version in pynput module because pyHook is not working anymore inspired by this keylogger and this is my desired output.

If you want to make it executable just install pyinstaller or nuitka to make it onefile and noconsole and independent to python and all libraries.
