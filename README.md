First we need to install in the terminal type pip install pynput

A Simple Python Keylogger saves a Text File with Current Day and Date and also has a Day, Date, Time, and Year for every Keystroke that wrote nice and readable 
Allmost keyboard keys are registered i think?

Still in the development
If you want to make it executable just install pyinstaller or nuitka to make it onefile and independent to python and all libraries

Sample Output:
